Agama web relies on Electrum proxy nodes to communicate with Electrum servers. You can either run your own proxies or use what's already hardcoded in the web wallet.

In order to use your own proxy modify the following file src/util/proxyServers.js

Electrum proxy source code is available here https://github.com/pbca26/electrum-proxy
